## Introduction
 - In this project I worked on creating an engaging game of Tic-Tac-Toe, with the goal of writing clean DRY HTML, CSS and JS.  Using game logic, I iterated over winning number sets to match the Players selections, resulting in a win or draw.  
## Technologies
 - Javascript
 - HTML
 - CSS
## Illustrations

## Features
- Users are able to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe and watch their scores increase on each win.
- Player turns will change on each game to allow players an equal amount of turns between games.
- The score columns will reflect the wins of each player.
- The main section will reflect the player's turn and if a player won or if it was a draw.
